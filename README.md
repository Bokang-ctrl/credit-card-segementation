## credit-card-segmentation

# Overview
This repository contains a dataset and Jupyter Notebook for credit card segmentation using 3 different models: DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, and KMeans clustering algorithms. The project aims to segment credit card users based on their spending behavior, allowing for targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.

# Notebook Content
Data Cleaning: The notebook begins with data cleaning steps to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies in the credit card dataset.

Data Scaling: Following data cleaning, the dataset is scaled using standardization or normalization techniques to ensure uniformity in feature scales.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving its variance. This step helps in visualizing the data and improving clustering performance.

KMeans Clustering: The notebook trains a KMeans clustering model on the preprocessed dataset to group credit card users into distinct segments based on their spending behavior.

DBSCAN Clustering: Additionally, DBSCAN clustering is employed to identify dense regions in the data and classify data points as core points, border points, or outliers.

# Methodology
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies to prepare the dataset for clustering analysis.

Data Scaling: Scale the features of the dataset to ensure uniformity in feature scales, enhancing the performance of clustering algorithms.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA to improve computational efficiency and visualization.

Clustering Algorithms: Train KMeans and DBSCAN clustering models to segment credit card users based on their spending behavior.

# Note
It's recommended to experiment with different data preprocessing techniques, clustering algorithms, and hyperparameters to optimize segmentation results based on specific business requirements.
Consider the interpretability and stability of clusters generated by different clustering algorithms when evaluating segmentation performance.
